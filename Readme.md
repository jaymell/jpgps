## Synopsis
Module and CLI util to quickly get date, GPS coordinates, and altitude out of geotagged JPEG files (not tested
with other formats, though may work for TIFFs)

## Motivation
Getting data out of images that is useful for plotting thumbnails on map and
otherwise determining relative positions between photos.

## Dependencies
python modules: exifread
 -- requirements.txt coming soon

## Misc.
* gps_distance.py is old code and probably buggy, but keeping it in repo for now, may update
it later
